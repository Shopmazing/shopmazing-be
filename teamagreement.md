# Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

## What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- Ben:
Debugging, JavaScript, analytics, API,
- Kirk:
Debugging, Front end, Work Flow, CSS
- Ed:
WorkFlow, 'big picture' organization, Bootstrap, UI
- Soni:
Research, Bootstrap, Heroku, Netlify, Database flow
- Jordan:
Communication, CSS, Front end

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Assign the tasks to each persons strengths. Partner strong skills with someone who isn't as proficient in that skill, so they can grow as we complete this project.

## In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Ben: 
Wireframe and data flow planning.
- Kirk:
Documentation of progress and planning of work flow.
- Ed:
JavaScript and communication
- Soni:
Time management and API integration.
- Jordan:
Time estimation and bookkeeping.

## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Morning standups, clear instructions on what we are trying to accomplish each day. End of day wrap ups to review what we accomplished. 

# Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

## What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Talk to each other directly, discuss it with another member of our group, 3rd party mediation. Contact TA or instructor if unable to resolve on our own.

## What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Discuss it with them, also switch Driver/Nav roles regularly.

## How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Our idea of pairing a person with a strong skill set in that catagory with someone who isn't as proficient to help each other grow.

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Talk with them about it and see if there is a reason for their lack of contrubtion. Morning standup task assignments to people and allowing them to choose what they would like to contribute to this team effort.

## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Bring in an instructor.

# Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

## What hours will you be available to communicate?

9am-6pm, but able to communicate after hours when available.

## What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack, Remo

## How often will you take breaks?

Hourly or as needed.

## What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Review what our MVP is, if needed, ensure the strong skillset members are working on the aspects of the project still needed to be completed. We can also work outside of the 9-6 hours if able and willing.

## How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack

## What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Morning standups, ensuring to let every member talk about what they're doing that day, and ask any questions or concerns. Create a safe work environment

## How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Morning standups, ensuring to let every member talk about what they're doing that day, and ask any questions or concerns. Create a safe work environment

# Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

Describe at least:

## How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Clearly define our MVP, switch driver and nav roles daily if not more often. Creating a good plan of what we are going to create and outline what tasks are needed via a project management tool.

## What project management tool will be used?

Trello

# Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

## What components of your project will live on GitHub?

The front and back end repo's

## How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Organization via GitHub

## What is your Git flow?

Staging branch as primary, feature branches we will merge into staging branch

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
## How many people must review a PR?

At least two

## Who merges PRs?

The person committing the code

## How often will you merge?

Upon feature completion or end of day

## How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

Via Slack and Remo, ensuring all members are aware of the merge before PR'ing.
